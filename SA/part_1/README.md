# Optional Exam Exercise
### Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (3 points) 
Implement a model based on  Pre-trained Language model (such as BERT or RoBERTa) for the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis task regarding the extraction of the aspect terms only. 
    
**Dataset**: The dataset that you have to use is the Laptop partition of SemEval2014 task 4, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/lixin4ever/E2E-TBSA/tree/master/data).

**Evaluation**:  For the evaluation you can refer to this [script](https://github.com/lixin4ever/E2E-TBSA/blob/master/evals.py) or the official script provided by [SemEval](https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/index.php?id=data-and-tools) (Baseline, Evaluation and Evaluation link). Report F1, Precision and Recall.
