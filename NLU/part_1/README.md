# Part 1 (4 points)
As for LM project, you have to apply these two modifications incrementally. Also in this case you may have to play with the hyperparameters and optimizers to improve the performance.

Modify the baseline architecture Model - - by:
- Adding bidirectionality
- Adding dropout layer

**Intent classification**: accuracy < br >
**Slot filling**: F1 score with conll

***Dataset to use: ATIS***

# TODOs
1. ~~model saving~~
1. ~~multiple runs to get avg and std~~
2. tensorboard support
3. bidirectionality
4. dropout layer
5. experiment config
6. it would be cool, for fun, to add model quantization during inference :P
